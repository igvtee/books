  But since 1999, "An empty list in a function declarator that is part of a
  definition of that function specifies that the function has no parameters"
  [C99 $6.7.5.3(14) and C11 $6.7.6.3(14)].
* set array size at runtime
* NaN is that testing for equality always fails - after setting x=NAN, even
  x==x will evaluate to false. Use isnan(x) to test whether x is NaN.
