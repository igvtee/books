sigsafe-0.1.3 (released 11 May 2004)
-------------

* Added support for several platforms:

  - Linux/alpha
  - Linux/ia64
  - Linux/x86_64
  - NetBSD/i386
  - Solaris/sparc
  - Tru64/alpha

* A split into single-threaded and multi-threaded versions, to support
  platforms with poor thread support. (*BSD systems.)

* Build system improvements.

  - The .sconf_temp and test directories are built in per-platform
    directories, along with the main system, so it's easier to share a build
    directory between many different platforms. (This makes testing on
    SourceForge's compile farm and HP's test drive systems easier.)

  - The single "scons" command will also build single-threaded and
    multi-threaded versions, where available.

  - The SConstruct file is more readable, with numerous comments. It should be
    easy to change, even for people who have never seen scons before.

* Better hiding of implementation details:

  - a separate header for internal functions
  - more static variables
  - private functions are marked with __attribute((visibility("private")))
    where available, always suffixed with _ to mark them as such.

* Documentation improvements, mostly notes about porting to new systems.

sigsafe-0.1.2 (released 1 May 2004)
-------------

* Added preliminary support for FreeBSD. (See RELEASE_NOTES.)

* A bit more documentation work. (More needed!)

* Added a test for sigsafe_select in the race checker, and found/fixed a bug
  that meant 4- and 5-argument system calls would not work properly under
  Linux/x86. (D'oh!)

* Added some additional tests for things that don't appear to be actual
  problems. Good.

* Workarounds for RedHat 9's half-completed epoll.

sigsafe-0.1.1 (released 23 Feb 2004)
-------------

* Documentation improvements: a better quick overview, the start of some
  background text, and a couple other pages that I will bulk out more later.
  It should be more a little more friendly to different audiences now.
  (There's still a ways to go.)

* Big improvements to the race condition checker. It now tests for more races
  (including a couple unsafe patterns I mentioned in the Background text),
  shows a nice table with actual/expected results, is much faster for a normal
  run, and lets you specify options at runtime.

* A new directory of tests - platform_behavior. Little experiments I ran on
  various platforms when the API confused me, where I was looking for bugs,
  or where behavior can vary from platform to platform. These might or might
  not be useful beyond when I wrote them, but I might as well stick them
  somewhere.

* Small build system changes - mostly fixing a bunch of typos/thinkos around
  the benchmark.

sigsafe-0.1.0 (released 15 Feb 2004)
-------------

* (Initial version)
