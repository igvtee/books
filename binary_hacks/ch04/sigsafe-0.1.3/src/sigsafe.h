 * User-specified handler type.
 * Arguments:
 * - <tt>int signo</tt>: The signal number received.
 * - <tt>siginfo_t *si</tt>: The signal information as passed to a
 *   sigaction-style signal handler.
 * - <tt>ucontext_t *ctx</tt>: The machine context of the program when
 *   the signal was received. After the user-defined handler exits, the
 *   platform-specific handler will kick in. It will decide if it is currently
 *   executing in a "jump region" of a sigsafe system call and adjust the
 *   instruction pointer if so. While <tt>ctx</tt> is not marked
 *   <tt>const</tt>, you should be very cautious modifying it. Your code will
 *   be non-portable, and you may interfere with sigsafe's operation. In fact,
 *   normally you will not need to even read this parameter.
 * - intptr_t user_data. The data you passed to sigsafe_install_tsd() in this
 *   thread.
 *
 * @warning
 * This handler is executed asynchronously. You must take care to only call
 * async signal-safe functions. In fact, the entire point of sigsafe is to
 * allow you to do very little here and handle the rest in the main program.
 * It's recommended that you only note details about the signal here, not take
 * any action.
 *
 * @par Portability:
 * Unfortunately, NetBSD does not support sigaction, as of the latest released
 * version (1.6.2). Thus, it has a different signature:
 * - <tt>int signo</tt>
 * - <tt>int code</tt> - similar to si->si_code with the standard handler
 * - <tt>struct sigcontext *ctx</tt> - similar to the standard handler's ctx.
 * - <tt>intptr_t user_data</tt>
 * Currently, you will need to use <tt>#ifdef SIGSAFE_NO_SIGINFO</tt> if you
 * wish to support NetBSD.
 *
 * @par Future releases:
 * I may change the API to have "simple" and "extended" versions of user
 * handlers, so that simple ones do not need to worry about these platform
 * differences.

 *                case sigsafe simply notes that a signal was received.

/**
 * @defgroup sigsafe_syscalls Signal-safe system call wrappers
 * These are alternate system call wrappers which are guaranteed to return
 * an <tt>EINTR</tt> immediately if a "safe" signal is delivered on or before
 * the transition back to userspace. In particular, they will return
 * <tt>EINTR</tt> if a signal has been delivered before the function call or
 * immediately before the transition to kernel space within the function. They
 * will also return <tt>EINTR</tt> on receipt of a "safe" system call in
 * kernel space even when using <tt>SA_RESTART</tt>. And they return error
 * values as negative numbers rather than through <tt>errno</tt>. These are
 * their sole visible differences from the standardized system calls of the
 * same names. Like the standardized system call wrappers, it will not return
 * with <tt>EINTR</tt> if the system call has already completed.
 * @par Usage example:
 * @code
 * ssize_t retval;
 * while ((retval = sigsafe_read(fd, buf, count)) == -EINTR) {
 *     handle_signal();
 * }
 * if (retval < 0) {
 *     printf("read error %zd (%s)\n", -retval, strerror(-retval));
 * } else if (retval == 0) {
 *     printf("stream end\n");
 * } else {
 *     printf("read %zd bytes\n", retval);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * @par Implementation:
 * Internally, these check a thread-specific value noting if a signal has
 * arrived. They then proceed with no regard to signals. The addresses of key
 * points of the code are known to the signal handler, which allows it to make
 * a long jump to the appropriate branch. Thus, they have virtually no
 * overhead over the standard system call wrappers.
 * @note
 * If you do not see the system call you want here, don't panic. It's very
 * easy to add new system calls in most cases.
