The trick to reading declarations is to read from right to left.
you can switch a type name and const

int const
	a constant integer
int const *
	a (variable) pointer to a constant integer
int * const
	a constant pointer to a (variable) integer
int * const *
	a pointer to a constant pointer to an integer
int const * *
	a pointer to a pointer to a constant integer
int const * const *
	a pointer to a constant pointer to a constant integer
