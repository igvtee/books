• Capturing traffic with Wireshark
• Analyzing wireless packet capture
• Extracting data from unencrypted protocols
• Merging packet capture files

wep:
	It is possible to crack the WEPencrypted data packets if we
	capture enough of these packets for analysis.
	we can also crack the key using aircrack-ng along with a dictionary.
#aircrack-ng –w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt –n 64 decryptwep-01.cap

decrypt wep cap file with password "69:6E:64:69:61"
#airdecap-ng –w 69:6E:64:69:61 decrypt-wep-01.cap
decrypt wpa cap file
#airdecap-ng –p ilovehate2 –s Seclab decrypt-wpa2-01.cap
