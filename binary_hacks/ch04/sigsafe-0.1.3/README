WHAT IS THIS?
=============

sigsafe is a C library for safely, reliably, and promptly handling signals
delivered to specific threads without significant overhead. This is a common
and challenging problem, and sigsafe can help. You'll find details in the
HTML documentation, either here from api/index.html or at:

    <http://www.slamb.org/projects/sigsafe/api/>

sigsafe includes code, documentation, a performance benchmark, and a
correctness tester that exhaustively searches for race conditions with the
ptrace(2) facility.

sigsafe is available for Linux/i386 and Darwin/ppc (OS X). More platforms
should be ready soon.

sigsafe is released under the MIT license.


WHAT'S THE CATCH?
=================

Unfortunately, sigsafe requires writing assembly for each platform - platform
being a combination of operating system and architecture. So far, it has been
ported to:

- Linux/x86
- Darwin/ppc

The other machines I have avaible to me are Linux/alpha, Tru64/alpha,
HP-UX/PA-RISC, Solaris/sparc, FreeBSD/x86, FreeBSD/alpha, and Linux/ia64.
I intend to eventually port it to most or all of them. Or, if you're
impatient, you can tackle a port yourself. It's not as bad as it sounds. See
the porting section below.


WHAT'S INCLUDED?
================

- the sigsafe wrappers and control functions themselves

- doxygen-generated API documentation

- a performance benchmark
  On the platforms I've tested so far, sigsafe performance is comparable to
  raw system call performance. But don't take my word for it - run the test
  yourself. It's easy!

- a correctness test - it exhaustively searches for race conditions by
  using process tracing to deliver the signal between each instruction
  boundary.


HOW DO I COMPILE IT?
====================

I used the scons build system avaible from <http://www.scons.org/>. It's
Python-based, so you will also need to install Python if you don't have it
already. (Or you could manually compile sigsafe; there aren't very many
files.) I apologize for the additional dependency, but scons is completely
superior to make+m4+sh+autoconf+automake. If I spent my time with an inferior
build system, I couldn't spend it on more important things like improving the
software itself.

Assuming you've installed scons, type:

    $ scons

at the top level. It will produce everything in a build-XXX-YYY-ZZZ directory.
Run the microbenchmark to see that performance is acceptable and the
correctness tester to see that sigsafe works (and the other ways don't). Copy
the library and include file to a suitable location, like /usr/local/bin.


HOW DO I ADD A SYSTEM CALL?
===========================

In most cases, it's quite easy to add a new system call to an existing
platform. You just need to:

- add the prototype to sigsafe.h.
- add it to the syscalls.h list for your platform.

Some system calls are emulated - actually library functions implemented in
terms of other, raw system calls. These are a bit more work. If it's not
obvious how you could implement in terms of a raw system call, ask around or
check your system's libc source code.


WHAT MAY I DO WITH THIS SOFTWARE?
=================================

This code is all released under the MIT license. The full license text is
below. The short version is that you may do anything with it you like
(including selling it) except claiming it as your own. You also must not sue
me if it doesn't meet your requirements.
