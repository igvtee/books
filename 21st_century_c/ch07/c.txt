* don't bother explicitly returning from main
* reaching the } that terminates the main function returns a value of 0
  [C99 and C11 $5.1.2.2(3)]
* we would need "int main(void)" to be clear that main is taking no arguments.
  But since 1999, "An empty list in a function declarator that is part of a
  definition of that function specifies that the function has no parameters"
  [C99 $6.7.5.3(14) and C11 $6.7.6.3(14)].
* set array size at runtime
* The C99 standard required conforming compilers to accept variable-length
  arrays(VLAs). The C11 standard took a step back and made it optional.
* array indices have to be integers. it's the law [C99 and C11 $6.5.2.1], and
  compilers will thus complain if you send a floating-point index.
* NaN is that testing for equality always fails - after setting x=NAN, even
  x==x will evaluate to false. Use isnan(x) to test whether x is NaN.
