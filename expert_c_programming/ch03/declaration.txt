You can't have any of these:
* a function can't return a function, so you'll never see foo()()
* a function can't return an array , so you'll never see foo()[]
* an array can't hold a function, so you'll never see foo[]()

You can have any of these:
* a function returning a pointer to a function is allowed: int (* fun())()
* a function returning a pointer to an array is allowed: int (* fun())[]
* an array holding pointers to functions is allowed: int (* foo[])()
