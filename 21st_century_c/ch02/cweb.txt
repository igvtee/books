* Every special code for CWEB has an @ followed by a single character.
  Be careful to write @<titles@> and not @<incorrect titles>@.
* Every segment has a comment, the code. It's OK to have a blank
  comment, but that comment-code rhythm has to be there, or else
  all sorts of errors turn up.
* Start a text section with an @ following by a space. Then expound,
  using TeX formatting.
* Start an unnamed chunk of code with @c.
* Start a named block of code with a title followed by an equals sign
  (because this is a definition): @<an operation@>=.
* That block will get inserted verbatim wherever you use the title.
  That is, each chunk name is effectively a macro that expands to the
  chunk of code you specified, but without all the extra rules of C
  preprocessor macros.
* Sections (like the sections in the example about group membership,
  setting up, plotting with Gnuplot, and so on) start with @* and 
  have a title ending in a period.
